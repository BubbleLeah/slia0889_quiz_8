**Imaging Technique Inspiration**  

This is an interactive installation. Users can interact with the particles on the screen by moving their palms. During the experience, the user feels as if he can manipulate water and fire. I hope to use this technology in my future projects. Because particle interaction can provide a richer interactive experience for the user. Users can feel that their actions directly affect the elements on the page, thus increasing their involvement and engagement. Users may become interested in playing with the particles or observing their movements, thus increasing their enjoyment of the project.
